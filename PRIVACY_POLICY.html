    <h1>Privacy Policy for InstaNurse</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Today's Date, e.g., October 26, 2023]</p>

    <p>
        Thank you for using InstaNurse. Your privacy is a top priority for us. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, and how it is used. By using our app, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.
    </p>

    <div class="disclaimer">
        <h3>Important Medical Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>
            InstaNurse is for **educational and informational purposes only.** It is **not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.** Always consult a qualified healthcare provider for any medical questions. In a medical emergency, call a doctor or emergency services immediately.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        Our core philosophy is to collect as little information as possible.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Information We DO NOT Collect</h3>
    <p>
        We do not collect any personal information that can identify you, such as your:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Name, email, or phone number</li>
        <li>Location</li>
        <li>Photos, contacts, or other files on your device</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You are **not required to create an account** to use InstaNurse.
    </p>

    <h3>Information Collected by Our Advertising Partner</h3>
    <p>
        To keep InstaNurse completely free, we partner with a third-party advertising service. This partner collects **non-personal information** to show you relevant ads. This information may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> Such as your device's Advertising ID.</li>
        <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> Used to determine a general, non-specific location.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Like your device type, operating system, and network.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This data is used by our partner to serve ads and is governed by their own privacy policy. We **do not have direct access to this information.**
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>
        The only purpose of the data collected by our partner is to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Support the App:</strong> By displaying ads, we can keep InstaNurse free for all users.</li>
        <li><strong>Provide Relevant Ads:</strong> This helps ensure you see ads that are interesting to you and are not repetitive.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Our Advertising Partner</h2>
    <p>
        We work with **Adsterra**. We recommend you review their privacy policy to understand how they handle your data.

    </p>

    <div class="disclaimer">
        <h3>Job Portal Disclaimer</h3>
        
        <p>The InstaNurse Job Portal is a **job aggregation service, not a recruitment agency.** We simply list job opportunities that have been officially published by healthcare organizations on their own websites. We do not announce or offer any jobs ourselves.</p>
        
        <h4>No Fees or Charges</h4>
        <p>This service is **completely free.** We will never ask you for money or financial information for job applications or placements. Be cautious of any fraudulent requests for payment.</p>
        
        <h4>Third-Party Websites</h4>
        <p>When you click "Apply Now," you will be sent to the official career portal of the hiring organization. We are **not responsible** for the content, application process, or data practices of these external websites. You are responsible for any data you submit to them.
    </div>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
